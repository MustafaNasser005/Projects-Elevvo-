# Student Performance Factors Analysis

This project analyzes various factors that influence student performance using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

The analysis explores the relationship between different factors (such as study time, attendance, parental education, etc.) and student academic performance. The project includes:

- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- **Feature Engineering**: Data preprocessing and feature selection
- **Machine Learning Models**: Multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Regression
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics and comparison
- **Predictions**: Student performance prediction capabilities

# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python that suggests similar movies based on TMDB (The Movie Database) datasets.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated content-based recommendation system that analyzes movie features including:
- **Genres** (Action, Adventure, Fantasy, etc.)
- **Keywords** (themes, topics, concepts)
- **Cast** (top 3 actors)
- **Crew** (director information)
- **Overview** (movie description)

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to find similar movies based on content similarity.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
  - CountVectorizer for text vectorization
  - Cosine Similarity for similarity calculation
- **NLTK** - Natural Language Processing
  - Porter Stemmer for text normalization
- **Pickle** - Model serialization
- **Streamlit** - Web application interface

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk streamlit
```

### Data Processing

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** to process the data and generate models:
```bash
jupyter notebook Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb
```

2. **The notebook will:**
   - Load and merge TMDB datasets
   - Extract and process movie features
   - Apply text preprocessing (stemming, lowercasing)
   - Create feature vectors using CountVectorizer
   - Calculate cosine similarity matrix
   - Save processed data as pickle files

### Running the Web Application

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser where you can:
- Select a movie from the dropdown
- Get personalized movie recommendations
- View similar movies based on content similarity

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Extraction**: Combines overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew
- **Text Processing**: Applies stemming and converts to lowercase
- **Vectorization**: Uses CountVectorizer with 5000 features

### 2. Similarity Calculation
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movie feature vectors
- **Recommendation Engine**: Finds movies with highest similarity scores

### 3. Recommendation Algorithm
```python
def recommend_movie(movie):
    index_movie = new_df[new_df['title'] == movie].index[0]
    distances = similarity[index_movie]
    movies_list = sorted(list(enumerate(distances)), 
                        reverse=True, key=lambda x:x[1])[1:6]
    
    for i in movies_list:
        print(new_df.iloc[i[0]].title)
```

## 📈 Key Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on content similarity
- **Multi-Feature Analysis**: Considers genres, cast, crew, and plot
- **NLP Processing**: Advanced text preprocessing for better accuracy
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can be extended with additional features

## 🎯 Example Recommendations

For "Batman Begins", the system recommends:
- The Dark Knight
- The Dark Knight Rises
- Batman
- Batman & Robin

## 📝 Notes

- **Model Files**: The `.pkl` files in `assets/` are generated by running the notebook
- **Large Files**: Model files are not tracked in git due to size limitations
- **Dataset**: Uses TMDB 5000 movies and credits datasets for comprehensive coverage
- **Performance**: Cosine similarity provides fast and accurate recommendations
